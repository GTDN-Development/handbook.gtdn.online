## What it means

Work is **not a place, but a result**. The office is optional — not required. Everything we do is set up so anyone can work 100% from anywhere.


## Why it works

- **Flexibility** → organize time and place as you like
- **Efficiency** → no wasted commuting, fewer distractions, more focus
- **Talent** → we can collaborate with people anywhere
- **Transparency** → clear documentation and async communication by default

## How we do it at GTDN

- Work = results, not hours online
- **Core hours 10:00–14:00 CET** → everyone available and responsive
- Communication is short and clear, async first → call if it’s faster
- Freedom comes with responsibility → you own both decisions and outcomes

## Tools we use to communicate with each other 

- **Google Chat** → to communicate minor updates and questions
- **Google Meet** → for meetings and demos
- **ClickUp** → not only for project management and task tracking, but also for collaboration, documentation, and knowledge sharing


## Manifesto

Remote-first is freedom and trust. Location doesn’t define our work, quality does.
