title: "Reporting"
description: "Reporting is simple and transparent — weekly updates, clear client summaries, and honest progress tracking."

## Internal Reporting

- **Weekly updates** → shared during Monday standup
- **Progress tracking** → visible in ClickUp boards for everyone

## Client Reporting

- **Updates** → shared proactively by email or call if needed
- **Milestones** → always reported when a major phase or feature is completed
- **Summaries** → short recap after meetings or delivery (only if necessary)

## Rules

- Keep reports **short, clear, and relevant**
- Visuals (screenshots, links, dashboards) > long text
- Transparency builds trust — problems are reported early, not hidden

## Manifesto

We don’t report to look busy.  
We report to keep everyone aligned, informed, and focused on results.
