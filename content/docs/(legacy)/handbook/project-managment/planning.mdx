description: "Planning and prioritization: simple Monday sessions, clear priorities, and focused tasks that deliver value every week."

## How we plan

- Every **Monday at 11:00 CET** we run a short planning session
- Each teammate shares what they’ll focus on during the week
- Tasks are pulled from the backlog and moved into **To Do** with clear owners

## Prioritization rules

- **Impact first** → the most valuable tasks for the client or company go first
- **Clarity** → every task must have a clear description before it can be prioritized
- **Focus** → fewer tasks, done well, beat overloaded boards
- **Flexibility** → priorities can shift mid-week if needed, but always communicated

## Priority Flags in ClickUp

- Priority is always added when the task moves into **To Do**
- Every task **must** have a priority
- If a task has no priority, assign one immediately

### Urgent (red)

- Must be handled **immediately** (today / within hours)
- Blockers for client delivery or critical bugs in production
- Takes priority over all other tasks

### High (yellow)

- Important tasks with deadlines this week
- Features or fixes with direct business/client impact
- Should be addressed right after urgent tasks

### Normal (blue)

- Standard tasks in the sprint or weekly plan
- Work that moves projects forward but isn’t time-critical
- Default setting if no special urgency

### Low (gray)

- Nice-to-have, long-term, or experimental tasks
- Won’t block delivery if postponed
- Good fillers if you finish higher-priority work early

## Manifesto

Plan lean. Focus on what matters most. Deliver value every week.
