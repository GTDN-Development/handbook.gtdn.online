## Why Handovers Matter

Projects change hands. Developers leave, clients take over maintenance, or a different team picks up the work. A bad handover creates months of confusion. A good one takes a few hours and saves everyone headaches.

## When Handovers Happen

- **Client takes over** - Project complete, client's team maintains it
- **Team transition** - Different developer takes ownership
- **Agency to agency** - Client moves to another vendor
- **End of contract** - Maintenance period ends

Regardless of the reason, the process is the same.

## The Handover Checklist

### 1. Documentation

Update or create:

- [ ] README with setup instructions
- [ ] Architecture overview (what connects to what)
- [ ] Environment variables list with descriptions
- [ ] Deployment process documentation
- [ ] Known issues and quirks
- [ ] Contact info for third-party services

### 2. Access Transfer

Transfer or share credentials for:

- [ ] GitHub repository (add their team, remove ours if needed)
- [ ] Vercel or hosting platform
- [ ] Railway or database hosting
- [ ] Domain registrar
- [ ] CMS admin accounts
- [ ] Third-party APIs (Stripe, email service, etc.)
- [ ] Analytics (Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

Use a password manager or secure sharing method. Never send credentials in plain email.

### 3. Domain & DNS

- [ ] Transfer domain to client's registrar, or
- [ ] Update domain contacts to client's info
- [ ] Document current DNS configuration
- [ ] Ensure client has access to make DNS changes

### 4. Repository

- [ ] All code pushed and merged
- [ ] No hanging branches with important work
- [ ] Dependencies up to date (or documented if not)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- [ ] Clean git history (squash WIP commits)

### 5. Hosting & Infrastructure

- [ ] Transfer project ownership in Vercel
- [ ] Transfer Railway project or provide access
- [ ] Document any scheduled tasks or cron jobs
- [ ] List all services and their purposes
- [ ] Provide database backup before transfer

### 6. CMS & Content

- [ ] Create admin account for new owner
- [ ] Document custom post types and fields
- [ ] Export content if migrating platforms
- [ ] Document any custom plugins or modifications

## The Handover Meeting

Schedule a call to walk through:

1. **Architecture** - How the system works, what talks to what
2. **Deployment** - How to push changes live
3. **Common tasks** - Adding content, updating pages, etc.
4. **Known issues** - Bugs we know about, workarounds
5. **Questions** - Answer anything unclear

Record the meeting if possible. Becomes documentation.

## Documentation Template

Create a `HANDOVER.md` in the repo:

```markdown
# Project Handover

## Overview
Brief description of what this project does.

## Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js on Vercel
- CMS: WordPress on Railway
- Database: MySQL on Railway

## Access Required
- GitHub: [repo-url]
- Vercel: [project-url]
- Railway: [project-url]
- WordPress Admin: [admin-url]

## Environment Variables
| Variable | Purpose | Where to get it |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| DATABASE_URL | Database connection | Railway dashboard |
| WORDPRESS_URL | CMS API endpoint | Railway public URL |

## Deployment
Push to `main` branch. Vercel deploys automatically.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a blog post
1. Log into WordPress admin
2. Posts > Add New
3. Publish

### Updating homepage
1. Pages > Home in WordPress
2. Edit content
3. Save (Next.js revalidates automatically)

## Known Issues
- [Issue description and workaround]

## Contacts
- Original developer: name@email.com (available until [date])
- Hosting support: Vercel/Railway support channels
```

## After Handover

### Support Period

Define clearly:

- How long we're available for questions (2 weeks typical)
- What's included (answering questions vs. fixing bugs)
- How to reach us during this period

### Clean Break

After support period:

- Remove our team's access (unless ongoing relationship)
- Archive internal documentation
- Close related tasks in project management
- Invoice any remaining work

## Receiving a Handover

When taking over someone else's project:

1. **Get all access first** - Don't start until you have everything
2. **Run it locally** - Verify setup instructions work
3. **Deploy a test change** - Confirm deployment process
4. **Check all integrations** - Make sure third-party services work
5. **Document what's missing** - Fill gaps in documentation

## The Rule

A project isn't done until someone else can maintain it without you. Documentation and clean handover are part of the job, not an afterthought.
