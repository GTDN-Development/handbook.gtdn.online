## What This Section Covers

This is our engineering knowledge base. Everything you need to know about how we build software, from setting up your machine to deploying to production.

- Development environment setup
- Our tech stack and why we chose it
- Git workflow and collaboration
- Deployment processes
- Infrastructure we maintain
- Common patterns and libraries

## Our Approach

We're an agency. We build apps and websites for clients. Sometimes we continue developing their existing apps with their stack. Sometimes we build from scratch with ours. We also have our own internal tools and products.

This shapes our technical decisions:

**Speed matters.** We pick tools that let us ship fast without sacrificing quality. Next.js, Tailwind, headless CMS - these are battle-tested and well-documented.

**Simplicity wins.** We don't over-engineer. The right tool for the job, not the most impressive one.

**Standards over snowflakes.** We follow conventions. When someone new joins a project, they should feel at home immediately.

**Concepts over specific tools.** Technology evolves quickly. The libraries and frameworks we use today might be different next year. Understanding the underlying concepts matters more than memorizing specific APIs.

## Keep It Updated

Found something outdated or missing? Fix it. This documentation is only useful if it reflects how we actually work today.
