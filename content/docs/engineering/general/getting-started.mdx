## First Things First

Before you start building, make sure you have:

1. Access to our GitHub organization
2. Your development environment set up
3. Access to our project management tools

## Prerequisites

- **Computer science basics** - you know what a pixel is, difference between SVG, JPEG, and PNG, what data types we can have, how the JSON look like...
- **Terminal** - navigating directories, running commands, reading output
- **Git** - confident usage, not just copy-pasting commands

Not confident in any of these? Brush up before diving in - it'll save you headaches.

## How it works

We build web apps for clients and ourselves. The workflow is simple:

1. **Task gets assigned** - You'll find tasks on the project board in our project management system
2. **You do the work** - Pick up the task, build the solution, test it
3. **Open a PR** - Push your branch and create a pull request (see [Git Workflow](/docs/engineering/general/git-workflow))
4. **Get it reviewed and merged** - Unless you're senior and confident, get a review first

### Bigger Tasks

Sometimes you'll get a broader scope like a whole project. In these cases:

- **Figure out the approach yourself** - Break it down, decide on implementation
- **Manage your own process** - Create subtasks, set up a mini-board, whatever helps you
- **Ask for input when needed** - Discuss with colleagues, get a second opinion on architecture

We care about results, not how you get there. Own your work, think for yourself, and ship.

## Questions?

Ask. Seriously. It's faster than guessing and breaking something. Use the team chat, tag someone who knows the project, or schedule a quick call if async isn't working.
