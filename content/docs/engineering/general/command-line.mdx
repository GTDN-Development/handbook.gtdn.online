## Why Command Line

GUIs are nice. The command line is faster once you know it. You'll use it daily for git, npm, navigating projects, and running scripts.

## Navigation

```bash
pwd                   # Print working directory (where am I?)
ls                    # List files and folders
ls -la                # List all files including hidden, with details
cd folder             # Change directory into folder
cd ..                 # Go up one directory
cd ~                  # Go to home directory
cd -                  # Go to previous directory
```

## Files and Folders

```bash
mkdir folder          # Create a directory
mkdir -p a/b/c        # Create nested directories
touch file.txt        # Create an empty file
cp file.txt copy.txt  # Copy a file
cp -r folder backup   # Copy a folder recursively
mv old.txt new.txt    # Rename or move a file
rm file.txt           # Delete a file (no undo!)
rm -rf folder         # Delete a folder and contents (dangerous!)
```

## Reading Files

```bash
cat file.txt          # Print entire file
head file.txt         # Print first 10 lines
tail file.txt         # Print last 10 lines
tail -f file.txt      # Follow file (useful for logs)
less file.txt         # Paginated view (q to quit)
```

## Searching

```bash
find . -name "*.js"           # Find files by name
grep "text" file.txt          # Search for text in file
grep -r "text" .              # Search recursively in current dir
grep -i "text" file.txt       # Case-insensitive search
```

## Pipes and Redirection

```bash
command > file.txt    # Write output to file (overwrites)
command >> file.txt   # Append output to file
command | grep text   # Pipe output to another command
```

## Process Management

```bash
Ctrl+C                # Stop running process
Ctrl+Z                # Suspend process
bg                    # Resume in background
jobs                  # List background jobs
kill PID              # Kill process by ID
killall node          # Kill all processes by name
```

## Environment

```bash
echo $PATH            # Print PATH variable
export VAR=value      # Set environment variable
env                   # List all environment variables
which node            # Find where a command lives
```

## Useful Shortcuts

```bash
Tab                   # Autocomplete file/folder names
Up/Down arrows        # Navigate command history
Ctrl+R                # Search command history
Ctrl+A                # Go to beginning of line
Ctrl+E                # Go to end of line
Ctrl+L                # Clear screen (or type 'clear')
!!                    # Repeat last command
```

## Permissions

```bash
chmod +x script.sh    # Make file executable
chmod 755 file        # rwx for owner, rx for others
chown user file       # Change file owner
```

## Networking

```bash
curl https://url      # Fetch a URL
curl -I https://url   # Fetch headers only
ping google.com       # Check connectivity
lsof -i :3000         # What's using port 3000?
```

## Vim Survival Guide

We're not Vim experts. But sometimes you end up in Vim (like when git opens it for commit messages) and need to escape.

**Absolute basics:**

```bash
i                     # Enter insert mode (now you can type)
Esc                   # Exit insert mode
:w                    # Save
:q                    # Quit
:wq                   # Save and quit
:q!                   # Quit without saving (force)
```

If you're stuck in Vim: press `Esc` a few times, then type `:q!` and press Enter. You're out.

To avoid Vim for git commits, set a different editor:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
git config --global core.editor "zed --wait"   # Zed
```

## Common Patterns

**Run something in background:**

```bash
npm run dev &
```

**Chain commands:**

```bash
npm install && npm run build    # Run second only if first succeeds
npm install; npm run build      # Run both regardless
```

**Run with sudo (admin):**

```bash
sudo command          # Run as admin (use sparingly)
```
