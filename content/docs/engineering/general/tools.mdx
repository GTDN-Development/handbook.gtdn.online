## Code Editors

### Zed

Our primary editor. Built in Rust, fast as hell, native AI integration.

[zed.dev](https://zed.dev)

### Cursor

AI-first editor based and the most popular VS Code fork.

### VS Code

Also acceptable. This is the safe choice.

[code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## AI Tools

### Gemini

Part of our Google Workspace. Use it for general assistance, writing, research.

### Claude Code / Open Code

Terminal-based AI coding assistants. Good for running multiple tasks at once, developing simple internal apps and so on.

## Version Control

### GitHub

All our code lives here. We use GitHub for:
- Code hosting
- Pull requests and code review
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

You need to be part of our GitHub organization.

### GitLab

Some of our clients are using it so we need sometimes as well.

## Containers

### Docker

We containerize databases, CMS instances, and sometimes full development environments.

### OrbStack

Docker Desktop alternative for Mac. Fast and lightweight.

[orbstack.dev](https://orbstack.dev)

## API Development

### Insomnia

For testing APIs, debugging requests, and documenting endpoints. It is fine to use PostMan as well.

## Database

### TablePlus

Clean database GUI. Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.

## Browser

For web dev, keep installed:

- **Chrome** - Primary for DevTools, debugging etc...
- **Firefox** - Testing, different rendering engine
- **Safari** - Testing for Mac/iOS users

Test in all of them before shipping.

## Terminal

Use whatever terminal you like, but built-in terminal works fine. Some popular alternatives:

- **iTerm2** - Classic Mac terminal replacement
- **Warp** - Modern, AI-powered terminal
- **Ghostty** - New, fast
