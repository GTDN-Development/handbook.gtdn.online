## Prerequisites

You need a Mac, Linux, or Windows machine with admin access. We primarily develop on Mac, so these instructions lean that way. Adapt as needed.

**Terminal basics are expected.** If not, read the Command Line page first.

If any command doesn't work, check the linked website for current instructions.

For desktop apps (code editors, database tools, etc.), see the Tools page.

## Homebrew (Mac only)

The package manager for Mac. Install it first, use it for everything else.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

[brew.sh](https://brew.sh)

## Git

Version control. Non-negotiable.

```bash
# Mac
brew install git

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install git
```

Configure it:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

## Node Version Manager (NVM)

Don't install Node directly. Use NVM so you can switch versions between projects.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal, then:

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

[github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Bun

Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager. We use it on some projects.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

[bun.sh](https://bun.sh)

## Docker

On Mac, install OrbStack (see Tools page). On Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

[docker.com](https://docker.com)

## PHP & Composer

For WordPress, Laravel, and other PHP projects.

```bash
# Mac
brew install php composer

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install php php-cli composer
```

[php.net](https://php.net) / [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org)

## Python

Some tooling requires Python.

```bash
# Mac
brew install python

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

[python.org](https://python.org)

## Verify Your Setup

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
docker --version
```

All should return a version number.

## Troubleshooting

**Permission errors on npm?** Don't use `sudo`. Fix your npm permissions or use nvm properly.

**Docker won't start?** On Mac, make sure OrbStack is running. On Linux, check if the docker service is active.

**Node version mismatch?** Check if the project has a `.nvmrc` file and run `nvm use`.

**Command not found after install?** Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`).
