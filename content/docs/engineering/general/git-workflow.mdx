## The Flow

1. Create a branch from `main` (or `dev` if the project uses it)
2. Do the work
3. Keep your branch up to date with the target branch
4. Push and open a pull request (PR)
5. Get it reviewed (seniors can skip and merge directly if confident)
6. Merge (squash and merge) and delete your branch

## Branch Strategy

**Most projects** use `dev` for development/staging and `main` for production.

```
main → production
dev → development/staging
feature/* → your work
```

**Small projects** may only have `main`. In these cases, direct commits are acceptable when:
- The change is small and tested (compiles, works locally)
- You're the only one working on it
- It's trivial (typo, copy update) or an emergency

Don't commit directly to `main` if the project has a `dev` branch, multiple people are working, or it's a significant change.

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive names with prefixes:

```
feature/add-contact-form
fix/broken-header-link
refactor/cleanup-auth-logic
chore/update-dependencies
```

Lowercase, hyphens, specific enough that someone knows what it's about.

## Commits

Write clear messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add email validation to contact form"
git commit -m "Fix mobile menu not closing on navigation"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "stuff"
```

Better to let AI generate the message than write "fix". `WIP` commits are fine early in development for simple features.

**Commit often, push often.** Small commits are easier to review and revert.

## Pull Requests

**Before opening:**
1. Pull latest from target branch and rebase
2. Run the linter
3. Test your changes locally

**The PR itself:**
- Clear title describing the change
- What, why, and context in description
- Screenshots for visual changes
- Link to the task if applicable
- Tag someone who knows the codebase

**Seniors:** If you're confident in your changes, you can skip the review and merge directly.

We typically use **squash and merge** to keep history clean. Delete your branch after merging.

## Common Commands

**Starting new work:**
```bash
git checkout dev  # or main
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

**Keeping your branch up to date** (do this frequently):
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature/my-branch
git rebase dev
```

**Undoing a commit (not yet pushed):**
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

**Undoing a commit (already pushed):**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Don't rewrite history on shared branches.

## When Things Go Wrong

If you're stuck:
1. Don't panic
2. Don't force push
3. Google the specific error (or ask AI)
4. Ask for help before making it worse

The reflog is your friend:

```bash
git reflog
```
