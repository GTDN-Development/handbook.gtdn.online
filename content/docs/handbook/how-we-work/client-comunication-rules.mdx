title: "Communication Rules with Clients "
description: "Client communication rules: clear, polite, and professional collaboration using email, Google Chat, WhatsApp, or calls — never social media."
---

## Channels

- **Email** → main channel for all client communication
- **Google Chat / WhatsApp / Phone calls** → possible if it makes sense for the client
- **ClickUp comments** → optional, only if the client has access
- **Never** communicate with clients through Messenger, Instagram, or other social media

## Style

- Keep messages **clear, short, and professional**
- Always be **polite and respectful**
- Confirm important points in writing (email or ClickUp), never rely only on calls
- Share updates proactively — don’t wait for the client to ask

## Meetings

- Scheduled only when necessary, with a clear agenda
- Send a short summary after every client meeting or call **if needed**
- Respect client’s time: be on time, be prepared, end when the goal is reached

## Deliverables

- Large files → always via Google Drive (link)
- Small files → attach directly in email or ClickUp task
- Always include links to GitHub, Figma, or other sources

## Manifesto

We keep client communication simple, polite, and transparent.  
Clarity first, no noise, no unnecessary meetings.
