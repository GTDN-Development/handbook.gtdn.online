## Manifesto

We value speed, clarity, and respect for each other’s time. We’d rather call than overcomplicate. Meetings are short, purposeful, and rare. Conflicts are solved directly and quickly. We stay available when it matters most. At GTDN, **results beat busyness — always.**

## Guide

### 1. Channels

- **Google Chat** → all internal comms
- **ClickUp** → comments on tasks, always tag the right person
- **Email** → clients only

### 2. Availability

- **Core hours: 10:00–14:00 CET** → everyone online and responsive
- Reply as fast as possible
- Always pick up the phone

### 3. Style

- Keep it **short and clear**
- If it’s easier to talk → **call right away** and solve it

### 4. Meetings

- **Weekly standup**: Monday 11:00 CET → quick overview + priorities
- No extra meetings unless needed
- Every meeting must have a clear goal and end when that goal is reached

### 5. Decision-Making

- Day-to-day tasks → you decide
- Bigger impact → consult, but you own the outcome
- Strategy & business → leadership decides with team input

### 6. Conflicts & Culture

- Handle conflicts **1:1**, never in group chat
- **No spam** → keep chats relevant
- Every project has its **own chat** to stay organized
