## Feedback

Feedback is continuous — given whenever it’s needed, in whatever form makes sense. A quick comment, a short call, or a note in the code is enough if it helps move things forward.

## Conflicts

Conflicts are addressed directly and without delay. We solve them one-on-one, with respect, honesty, and zero ego. The goal is never to win an argument, but to keep trust strong and projects moving.
