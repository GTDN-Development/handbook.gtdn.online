We keep meetings rare, short, and purposeful. Every meeting has a clear goal and ends the moment that goal is reached.

Our one fixed ritual is the weekly standup every [**Monday at 11:00 CET**](https://meet.google.com/xsk-fkor-jzs) — a quick overview of priorities and who’s working on what.
Anything else happens only if necessary. Most things are solved faster with a message or a short call.
